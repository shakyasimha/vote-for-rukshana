## What is her background?

Started her activism journey at the age of 15 by writing blogs to raise her repressed voice, which later transitioned into actively advocating and protesting for the inclusion of Nepala Bhasa in school curricula, restoring Nhoo Pukhoo (Rani Pokhari) to its original form, stopping the displacement of the Newa community due to road expansion, and fighting for language justice. She also fought against Tribhuvan University, which had denied her registration because of her transgender identity.
In 2018, she co-founded Queer Youth Group (QYG), a pioneering institution that organizes the Annual Pride Parade and provides legal aid to queer folks, specifically focusing on transgender individuals’ right to identity. QYG also initiates several public interest litigations regarding inclusion in rape laws, marriage equality, citizenship rights, reservations in government jobs, and access to education.
Her activism on the streets transitioned into litigation in the courtroom in 2020. During this process, she secured interim orders from the Supreme Court allowing her to register at Purbanchal University, and she continues to fight for other queer individuals and marginalized groups.
Her litigations also include the establishment and implementation of indigenous and local languages as official languages of the state.
In 2023, her family was evicted by the local government from their ancestral residence. This prompted her to initiate a front called Thāe Bāe yā Lwāpu, which advocates for the ownership rights of the Jugi community’s traditional residences.
She was born with a physical disability called clubfoot deformity and lives with a residual disability, bringing lived experience regarding accessibility and persons with disabilities to the political stage.
She has also authored over 20 books on gender, sexuality, and Nepala Bhasa in three different languages.

## Why should you vote for her?

Everyone promises to build roads. But who asks how those roads affect the homes and livelihoods of indigenous and local communities? Is the road safe for children? Can senior citizens walk them with peace of mind? Can people with disabilities use them independently? I am running in this election to look closely at these very issues. My work will focus on legislative initiatives for social justice, serving as a voice for underrepresented communities across Nepal.
